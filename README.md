* Project 4: Machine Language 

-> Writing two Hack assembly language files, fill.asm and mult.asm.


* Project 5: Computer Architecture  

-> Building the following chips: Memory, CPU, Computer.

* Project 6: Assembler  

-> Using a high-level language to develop an assembler that translates programs written in the Hack assembly language into Hack binary code. This assembler is written    by C, and here is the URL of the demo video. https://youtu.be/Z61_f5j3IKA
